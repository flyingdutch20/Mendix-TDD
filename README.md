Test Driven Development in Mendix

This repository contains a tutorial to do Test Driven Development in Mendix and three Mendix Packages;
* UnitTest.mpk - the testing framework
* RomanNumerals.mpk - the finished Roman Numerals application with several iterations of Microflows
* RomanNumerals_UnitTests.mpk - the unit tests for the stories to build the Roman Numerals application

The packages were built with the Mendix Modeler version 7.10.0.

Enjoy!
